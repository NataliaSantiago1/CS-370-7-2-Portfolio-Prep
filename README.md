Project Reflection

Brief Explanation of Work

I worked on the development of an intelligent agent to play the treasure hunt game using deep Q-learning. The goal was to create a pirate agent that would navigate a maze and reach the treasure before a human player could do so. Initial starter code provided contains: TreasureMaze.py - which set up the environment for the game, GameExperience.py - contained code for experience replay. A Jupyter Notebook that contains code, partially implemented, for training and testing an agent.

The code I wrote myself focuses essentially on the implementation of Jupyter Notebook, making sure the Q-training algorithm completes. That is, one has to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm to train an agent in such a way that it learns an optimum path-finding strategy. I have implemented logic for balancing exploration and exploitation and handling the training loop/experience replay.

Connecting Learning to the Larger Field of Computer Science

Throughout this course, I have learned knowledge and acquired skills that really enriched me to understand computer science and its wide applications.

The complex problems are solved by computer scientists using computational methods and algorithms. They create software, develop efficient algorithms, and put into place new technologies that underpin the progress in areas like healthcare, finance, entertainment, and so on. It matters because their work underpins most points of modern life, from smartphones to advanced medical diagnostics to autonomous vehicles.

Being a computer scientist, I solve problems in a structured manner. I start by analyzing the issue to determine its requirements and extent. Then, I break it down into smaller components that are manageable. In devising solutions, I mostly make use of algorithms and data structures by iterating through design, implementation, testing, and optimization phases. The employment of computational thinking, critical analysis, and leveraging of existing technologies and frameworks become vital in solving such complex problems with much efficiency.

Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization 

Ethical responsibilities involved in the area of computer science include the following. To the end user, my responsibilities involve taking care of privacy, security, and usability of the systems and software developed. Solutions being developed should ensure efficiency and effectiveness to consider respect for users' rights and data integrity. Concerning ethical responsibilities within the organization, these include transparency of operations, adherence to legal standards, and an enabling environment for responsible technology practices. It's also about being sensitive to the fact that certain technologies and solutions that I would create could have significant positive impacts on greater society.

Conclusion

The project gives a reason to reflect on how important artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and algorithms are in solving complex problems. The actual development of an intelligent agent, observing its learning and improvement, has been really satisfying with deep Q-learning. This project has polished not only my technical skills but also showed me the greater implications and ethical concerns related to the field of computer science.

By continuously reflecting and connecting the course work to practical application, I will be in a better position to understand the implications of my work and remain committed to responsible behavior within the ever-evolving world of technology.
